# News Headlines Via REST API

## Introduction
Create an HTML page that retrieves news headlines via a REST API,
and prints them out in a nice format.

For this assignment, focus on a particular newspaper, The Times of India.

## REST API
Explore and use the [News API](https://newsapi.org/s/the-times-of-india-api)
to obtain the *Top Headlines* from The Times of India.

You will have to register on the News API site to obtain an API key.

## Javascript
The REST API invocation must be done in Javascript running on your HTML
page. See this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36975619/how-to-call-a-rest-web-service-api-from-javascript) on how that can be done.

## Input
A simple HTML submit button. Sample:

## Processing
Clicking the button should trigger your Javascript code, which would then
need to do the following:
- Fetch The Times of India news headlines using [News API](https://newsapi.org/s/the-times-of-india-api).
- Render the headlines on the HTML page.

## Output
A list of **clickable** headlines. Sample:
