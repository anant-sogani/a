# News Headlines Via REST API

## Introduction
Create an HTML page that retrieves news headlines via a REST API,
and prints them out in a nice format.

For this assignment, focus on a particular newspaper, The Times of India.

## REST API
Explore [News API](https://newsapi.org/s/the-times-of-india-api) to learn
how to obtain the **Top headlines** from The Times of India.

You will have to register on their site in order to obtain an API key.
This key will be required to authorize all your HTTP GET requests.

## Javascript
The REST API invocation must be done in Javascript running on your HTML
page. See this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36975619/how-to-call-a-rest-web-service-api-from-javascript) on how that can be done.

## Input
A simple HTML button `Get Headlines`.

## Processing
Clicking the button should trigger your Javascript code, that fetches
the news headlines from The Times of India, using the News API.

## Output
A neat list of headlines.
